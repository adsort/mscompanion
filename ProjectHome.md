# Steps of Using MSCompanion #

0. Please keep in mind this software is not a stand-alone tool dealing with every mapping issue, it is just a wrapper of Mapserver utilities including shp2img, orginfo, gdalinfo and so on. In other word, it is a Mapfile WYSIWYG editor closely relying on Mapserver's capabilities. So, before use this tool, remember install the required utilities metioned, as a suggestion, MS4W is my favorite choice.

1. Extract the exe file from MSCompanion`*`.zip to any folder of your computer.

2. Click the file to start.

3. Before you start to author a mapfile, you have to tell MSCompanion where the Mapserver Utilities locate, as well as other neccesary utilities, library files and projection related files. You can let MSCompanion guess the folder where the required files locate, but usually you need some patience before it find the right result.
For your reference, My installation of MS4W is at D:\ms4w, the paths look like this:

4. At this point, just new a file, right click the root node, and select "Layer Operations" -> "add Layer", then, I think you need not any more words.
